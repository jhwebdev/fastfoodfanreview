<div id="paragraph_"><p>In this review I’ll be reviewing McDonald’s famous burger: The Big Mac. The Big Mac is $10 and it comes with medium fires and a 
medium pop of your choosing. $10 for Fast food isn’t anything special but don’t get me wrong its definitely not bad, its just something that’s not 
worth praising for or anything. After I received my food I realized the fries were presented well because they were stacked a box very well, but when 
I opened the big mac I was disgusted because some of the lettuce fell out and the cheese was only half in the burger. Luckily the taste makes up for 
presentation because once I took a bite I instantly realized they had the perfect amount of their signature sauce on the burger and well the burger 
tasted great and the fires had just the right amount of salt in this McDonalds Review I’ll be reviewing the famous Big Mac. The Big Mac goes for $10, 
and it comes on them. After I finished my meal I was filled up but I wasn’t so full where it was hard to move, so bonus points for that. 
The taste and portion size really make up for the poor presentation of this meal so I’ve decided to give this burger a 4 out of 5 burgers.<a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/ca/en-ca.html">Look here to see McDonalds website!</a>
