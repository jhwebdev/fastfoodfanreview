<div id="paragraph_"><p>A&W doesn't really have any signature burgers or food so i decided to eat and review their teen burger with onion rings and a
and a medium beverage.The price was a bit over $11 which is a terrible deal for this meal because the burger itself isn't even that big and with that 
kind of money you could go to an actual restaurant, and get a superior burger in almost every-way. The presentation and taste of the onion rings 
were probably one of the best tasting onion rings I've ever had in a fast food restaurant, but the burger wasn't anything to write home about but it was 
still pretty decent. Finally we have the portion size, the burger did not fill me up at all, but the onion rings did but that was because the onion
rings are $5 which is ridiculous and thats why the meal ended up being over $11. In all the food and presentation was executed well but if you want to 
actually be filled up you have to pay $11 dollars which is way to pricey for fast food so I've decided to give this meal a 3 burgers out of 5.<a href="https://web.aw.ca/en/home">Check out this family friendly website!</a>
